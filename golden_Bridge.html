    <h1>Golden Bridge</h1>
    <p>Golden Bridge is a bridge in Vietnam that was built just a few years ago. It is part of a resort and it goes over cliffs, not water.  It goes from a cable car to the gardens, but it's also nice to walk just for the view.  The most special thing about it is how it's held up, by two giant concrete hands.</p>
