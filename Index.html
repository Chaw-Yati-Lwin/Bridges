        <h1>Golden Gate Bridge</h1>
        <p>The Golden Gate Bridge is in San Francisco, California. Despite rumors, the bridge is not a golden color nor named after the Gold Rush. It was actually  named after the Golden Gate Strait,  the stretch of water below the bridge. The Golden Gate Bridge was the longest suspension bridge in the world until 1964.</p>

        <h1>Charles Bridge</h1>
        <p>The Charles Bridge is a gothic structure built during the medieval times in Prague. It crosses the Vltava River and was the most important connection between the Prague Castle and the city's Old Town. The bridge is not built for cars to cross, so artists and musicians can be found playing along its edges.</p>

        <h1>Golden Bridge</h1>
        <p>Golden Bridge is a bridge in Vietnam that was built just a few years ago. It is part of a resort and it goes over cliffs, not water.  It goes from a cable car to the gardens, but it's also nice to walk just for the view.  The most special thing about it is how it's held up, by two giant concrete hands.</p>
